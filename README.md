# RADServer Samples

I plan to add a number of RAD Server Examples here. 
Many of the previous RAD Server code snippets are linked to blogs on https://delphiaball.co.uk/tag/rad-server/

## SenchaMail
The SenchaMail sample example uses the SENCHAMAILSERVER.IB database. (found in the data folder)
This is an InterBase database that stores emails, contacts, and labels that are applied to the email. 
To use the sample, either place the database at C:\data\SENCHAMAILSERVER.IB or update the connection path in the FDConnection1 components found in unitLabels and unitData.

The sample acts as a backend for persisting data from the JavaScript client sample created by Stuart98
